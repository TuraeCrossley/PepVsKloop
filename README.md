In this portfolio project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to compare the performance of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City and Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool in the English Premier League since the 2016/2017 season. The aim was to gain insights into the teams' achievements, such as total wins, win percentages, goal differences, and head-to-head performance. Python and pandas were used as the primary tools for data analysis, and matplotlib was employed for data visualization.

Data:
The project utilized two datasets: "Pep_Kloop_Analysis_June23.csv" containing information about the teams' performance metrics, and "premier-league-matches.csv" with details of the Premier League matches. The datasets included columns such as Season_End_Year, Team, Pos (position), W (wins), D (draws), L (losses), GF (goals scored), GA (goals conceded), GD (goal difference), Pts (points earned), and FTR (full-time result).

Analysis and Findings:

Total Wins Comparison:

A bar chart was created to compare the total wins of Manchester City and Liverpool over the seasons. Manchester City consistently had a higher number of wins compared to Liverpool in most seasons. However, Liverpool had a significant increase in wins during the 2019/2020 season, finishing as the champions.

Stacked Bar Chart: Wins, Draws, and Losses Comparison:

A stacked bar chart was generated to compare the wins, draws, and losses of both teams over the seasons. Manchester City had a higher number of wins and fewer losses compared to Liverpool in most seasons.
Liverpool had a higher number of draws in some seasons, indicating a slightly more cautious approach.
